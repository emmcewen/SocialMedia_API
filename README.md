 ## Social Media API

This backend API is a social network web application where the users can share their thoughts, react to a friends' thought, and create a friend list. 

## Use
* `run npm i express`To install Express.js,
* `run npm i mongoose` To install Mongoose DB
* `run npm run start` to start server to run code in Insomnia

Once the terminal gives you the "server Connected on localhost:3001" you can run the code in insomnia to see if the routes are all working. 

* `Test GET localhost:3001/users to pull all users`
* `Test POST localhost:3001/users and add body JSON and required string information into the body to Add Users`
* `Test DELETE localhost:3001/users/"useridtoken" to delete user from the db`
* `Test GET localhost:3001/users/"useridtoken" to get single user info`
